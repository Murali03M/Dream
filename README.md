# Dream

Attending the classes from Venky Anna.
In the repository, I have basic HTML, CSS, and javascript code and some basic projects and clones. 

1) Medicio copy :
    I have created the clone website of https://bootstrapmade.com/medicio-free-bootstrap-theme. I have not used the bootstrap. I have used only html and css.
2) Rock, Paper and Scissors game :
   Using basic javascript functionality the game was created.
